# Impressions

I enjoyed so much the development of this task. Î•ven though it looked easy, \
it had all the necessary things to present your knowledge, as much as possible. \
I had fun with developing both sides (frontend and backend), creating the api's \
but also creating the frontend (Material UI made things easier). 

One thing I found challenging was to develop of randomize functionality. I m not sure I understood 100% \
the requested functionality, but I thought it would be better to make an Api also for that.

Finally, I think the task was very good. if I added something, it would be to handle a large number of data. \
In this way we could use pagination on requests and maybe redis for faster responses. But it did not \
seem suitble in this case, since we were developing an App for a StandUp with a small number of people. \
Thank you very much.
